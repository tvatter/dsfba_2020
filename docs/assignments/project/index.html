<p>For this assignment, you will work on a real data science project.
The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing.
You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results.</p>
<h3 id="project-team">Project Team</h3>
<p>You may work individually or in a team.
If part of a team, you will work closely with other classmates (a maximum of 2 students per team) on this project. You can come up with your own teams or use the comment section of this website to find a teammate.
If you can&rsquo;t find partners we can help you find a team.
In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each group member will be different.
However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each group member based on peer assessments (see below).</p>
<h3 id="project-milestones">Project Milestones</h3>
<p>There are a few milestones for your final project.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>No extensions will be given for any of the project due dates except for medical reasons.</li>
<li>Projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
<p>There are several deliverables for your project that will be graded individually to make up your final project grade.</p>
<h3 id="project-proposal">Project proposal</h3>
<p>Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/jo4d9VfXMcyeUy3L8">this google form</a> to propose a project by <strong>March 15, 2020</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The title can be changed at a later date.</li>
<li>Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one form.</li>
<li>At this stage, we reserve the right to reject a project proposal if it is not
judged satisfactory. But the goal is mostly to set you on a path to succeed!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-udpate">Project udpate</h3>
<p>Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/is3WeajE5DW3F4z3A">this google form</a> to update us on your project by <strong>April 26, 2020</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the title is final at this points.</li>
<li>Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one form.</li>
<li>At this stage, we reserve the right to schedule a meeting to provide additional guidance if
the update is not judged satisfactory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-report">Project report</h3>
<p>The final report is composed of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>RMarkdown and compiled HTML files describe the project in details.</li>
<li>A peer assessment report the contribution of each individual member.</li>
<li>The slides from your presentation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rmarkdown-and-compiled-html">RMarkdown and compiled HTML</h4>
<p>The most important deliverable of your project is the set of RMarkdown and compiled HTML files by <strong>May 25, 2020</strong>.
They should detail your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got.
Equally important to your final results is how you got there!
Your RMarkdown and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project.
We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.</p>
<p>Your RMarkdown should include the following topics.
Depending on your project type, the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Overview and Motivation</strong>: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Related Work</strong>: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, or something we discussed in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Questions</strong>: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data</strong>: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploratory Analysis</strong>: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modeling</strong>: What are the different statistical methods you considered? Why did you choose a given model?
How about competing approaches?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Analysis</strong>: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your RMarkdown file and compiled HTML file are standalone documents that fully describe your process and results.
For instructions on how to submit, please see <strong>Submission Instructions</strong> below.</p>
<p>As a side note, the following scale will be used to grade projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview, motivation, related work, research questions: 10/100</li>
<li>Data: 15/100</li>
<li>EDA: 30/100</li>
<li>Modeling: 15/100</li>
<li>Final analysis: 20/100</li>
<li>Aesthetics, english writing, project organization, code quality: 10/100</li>
<li>Additionally, you have the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 20/100 (e.g., by using interactive visualization or presenting your work in especially interesting ways, for instance by complementing your report with a website generated with markdown).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="code">Code</h4>
<p>We expect you to write high-quality and readable R code in your RMarkdown file.
You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reproducibility, efficiency, cleaning data, etc.
We also expect you to document your code.</p>
<h4 id="peer-assessment">Peer Assessment</h4>
<p>It is important to provide positive feedback to your teammate and to also make suggestions to those you perceived not to be working as effectively on team tasks.
We ask you to provide an honest assessment of the contributions of the members of your team, including yourself. The feedback you provide should reflect your judgment of each team member:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: were they prepared during team meetings?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong>: did they contribute productively to the team discussion and work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respect for others’ ideas</strong>: did they encourage others to contribute their ideas?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: were they flexible when disagreements occurred?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your teammates&rsquo; assessment of your contributions and the accuracy of your self-assessment will be considered as part of your overall project grade.
The peer assessment is due <strong>May 26, 2020</strong>.
For instructions on how to submit, please see <strong>Submission Instructions</strong> below.</p>
<h3 id="project-presentation">Project presentation</h3>
<p>Each team will prepare a <strong>seven minutes presentation</strong> showing a demo of your project and/or some slides.</p>
<p>We will <strong>strictly enforce the time limit</strong>, so please make sure you are not running longer.
Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across.
Focus the majority of your presentation on your main contributions rather than on technical details.
What do you feel is the best part of your project?
What insights did you gain?
What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away?
Make sure it is upfront and center rather than at the end.</p>
<p>We use the following <a href="https://dept.writing.wisc.edu/wac/the-challenge-of-evaluating-oral-presentations/">criteria to evaluate oral presentations</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content (4/20)</li>
<li>Organization (4/20)</li>
<li>Teamwork (4/20, project done individually automatically earn the 4 points)</li>
<li>Visuals (4/20)</li>
<li>Presentation mechanics (4/20)</li>
</ul>
<p>The project presentations will be during class on <strong>May 25, 2020</strong>, and slides should be submitted by the same day.
For instructions on how to submit, please see <strong>Submission Instructions</strong> below.</p>
